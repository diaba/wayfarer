# Wayfarer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

#### Sprint 1: Landing Page

#### Sprint 2: HomePage

1. View the "San Francisco" page (at "/cities/1") including:
  - The site-wide header.
  - The name of the city.
  - An iconic photo of the city.
2. View a list of posts on the San Francisco page:
  - Sorted by newest first.
  - With the post titles linked to the individual post "show" pages.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Getting Started
Current working branch is the dev branch. Make sure to navigate to the dev branch when running these commands
#### Mac Installation Guide
1. Install node
```
sudo yum install nodejs
```
2. Install Angular CLI
```
npm install @angular/cli
```
3. Install necessary packages
```
npm install
```
4. Run locally
```
ng serve
```

### Approach
1. Plan git workflow (forked version)
1. Discussed user stories and wireframes
    - planned out different component needed to accomplish the requirements
    - used git projects to outline the project milestones
1. Set up the angular app
1. Researched...
    - Routing
    - Weather API
1. Started out with pair programming then individual tasks

### Challenges vs. Non-challenges
#### Challenges
- routing: initially a challenge
- CSS
- Working with a service
- Saving fetch data from an API (Possibly an async issue)

#### Easier than we thought
- Rendering a single component (excluding the navbar component) to a specific route

### Lesson Learned
- Communicate tasks clearly before ending meeting
- Document git workflow
- Dynamically creating components with *ngFor*  

### Next Steps
- Refactor all data calls using service
- Organize file structure
- Deploy
